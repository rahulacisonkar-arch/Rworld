# Test Data

Test PDF files are distributed as a zip archive to avoid Git LFS dependencies.

## Setup

Extract the test data before running knowledge layer tests:

```bash
# From the repository root
unzip tests/knowledge_layer_tests/data/Knowledge_Layer_Test_Data.zip -d tests/knowledge_layer_tests/data/
```

This extracts the following files:

- `ijms-22-05262.pdf` - Biomedical research paper (cystic fibrosis)
- `ijms-22-06193.pdf` - Biomedical research paper (cystic fibrosis therapies)
- `multimodal_test.pdf` - PDF with tables and images for multimodal extraction testing
